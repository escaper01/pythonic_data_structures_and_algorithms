Made this repository to practice my understanding of DSA. In addition to that, I solved multiple problems using them.

### 1 - Stack

- Valid Balanced Parentheses
- Reverse String
- convert integer to binary

### 2 - Single Linked List

- features: append, delete, length, swap, reverse, remove duplicate, merge, count occurrences, pivot
