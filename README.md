# Pythonic way to implement popular data structures and algorithms

Made this repository to practice my understanding of DSA. In addition to that, I solved multiple problems using them.

### 1 - Stack

- Valid Balanced Parentheses
- Reverse String
- convert integer to binary

### 2 - Single Linked List

- features: append, delete, length, swap, reverse, remove duplicate, merge, count occurrences, pivot
- palindrome checker
- sum two linked lists

### 3 - Circular Linked List

- features: append, length, print list, remove, is circular, split
- Josephus problem

### 4 - Doubly Linked List

- features: append, print_list, prepend, add_before_node, add_after_node, delete, remove_duplicates
- Pair with sum

### 5 - Array

- plus_one, two_sum_brute_force, two_sum_hash_table,two_sum
- optimal task assignment, intersection list, buy_and_sell_stocks
